# Overview

This project is a production-style semiconductor manufacturing analytics dashboard built using:

- Python
- Streamlit
- DuckDB
- Pandas
- Plotly

The dashboard automates:
- raw test file ingestion
- ETL transformation
- KPI aggregation
- yield monitoring
- defect pareto generation
- retest analytics
- handler/site analysis
- automated HTML report exports

The analytics workflows were designed around semiconductor final-test manufacturing operations, including lot-level yield tracking, retest analysis, defect monitoring, and equipment-level performance investigation.

## Data Sources

The dashboard pipeline processes manufacturing production data originating from:
- raw `.txt` production logs
- `.log` equipment output files

The ETL pipeline standardizes and transforms these semi-structured files into analytics-ready DuckDB tables for downstream KPI monitoring and reporting.

# Architecture & Technology Decisions

## Why DuckDB

DuckDB was selected as the primary analytics database because it provides:

- lightweight deployment
- fast analytical query performance
- minimal infrastructure overhead
- embedded SQL analytics capability
- easy portability within restricted enterprise environments

The project environment had limitations on deploying and managing heavier database platforms such as SQL Server or PostgreSQL, so DuckDB provided a highly effective local analytics solution for manufacturing KPI workloads.
---

## Why Streamlit

Streamlit was selected because it enabled rapid development of interactive analytics dashboards without requiring enterprise BI licensing or additional infrastructure.

Benefits included:

- lightweight deployment
- Python-native integration
- rapid visualization development
- standalone HTML export generation
- simplified maintenance for internal reporting workflows

This allowed the dashboard to function as a practical alternative for internal manufacturing analytics and reporting under constrained tooling environments.
